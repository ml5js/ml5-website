  The U-Net is a convolutional neural network that was developed for biomedical image segmentation at the Computer Science Department of the University of Freiburg, Germany.[1] The network is based on the fully convolutional network [2] and its architecture was modified and extended to work with fewer training images and to yield more precise segmentations.

The U-Net is a convolutional neural network that was developed for biomedical image segmentation at the Computer Science Department of the University of Freiburg, Germany.[1] The network is based on the fully convolutional network [2] and its architecture was modified and extended to work with fewer training images and to yield more precise segmentations.

<br/>

UNET allows you to segment an image, removing, for example, the background from video of you while sitting at your desk.

## Example

```javascript
// load your model...
const uNet = ml5.uNet('face');

// assuming you have an HTMLVideo feed...
uNet.segment(video, gotResult);

function gotResult(error, result) {
  // if there's an error return it
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return;
  }
  // log your result
  console.log(result)
}

```


## Syntax


```javascript
ml5.uNet(model)
```

```javascript
ml5.uNet(model, ?callback)
```

### Parameters

- `model` - A string to the path of the JSON model.
- `callback` - Optional. A callback function that is called once the model has loaded. If no callback is provided, it will return a promise that will be resolved once the model has loaded.

## Properties

```javascript
.ready
```

> Boolean value that specifies if the model has loaded.


## Methods

```javascript
.segment(video, ?callback);
```

> Segments the image

- `video` - Optional. A HTML video element or a p5 video element.
- `callback` - Optional. A function to run once the model has been loaded.
